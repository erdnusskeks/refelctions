How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can compare the changes line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You don't need to keep every (old) file you ever worked on. You can just 
    compare your last version with the version before and so you find changes 
    which you can fix (if necessary).

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: You can see the changes and compare them at once.
    Con: It might be a bunch of work to compare line by line.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    One commit should depend on one logical change that is made within the files.
    So it makes sense to have that all together in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First you use git log to find the commit ID you need.
    To see the changes you can compare the commit (= commit2) with the previous one (= commit1, that is just underneath the commit not above): 
    git diff commit1 commit2 (first argument = "original", second argument = "new" version; additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first)
    commit1 = commit before the last commit
    commit2 = last commit (commit with new changes)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always be sure to skip back to a former version that worked well.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Showing me the history of my files.
